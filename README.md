# data-analysis-project

My non-coder friend asked me "to write some script to hack a CS:GO roulette website" (https://csgorun.org/). Well, it isn't actually a hack, but my friend and I spent 1 night coding it and my friend was like a "solution manager" watching me writing code and suggesting ideas.
I used selenium for data parsing and scikit-learn for ML stuff.
### Actually, here is what we have done:
- collect_data.py gets necessary data from the website and pack it in two .csv files
- model.py is a dead simple ML model that unpack the data from .csv files and predict the next coefficient

It didn't work as we planned, lol, but it was quite predictable, because I have a very little knowledge in ML. Nevertheless, it was fun!
